#### How can Tokenization be used for a Rating Classifier Project
#### Tokenization can be used to develop a deep-learning model for classifying user reviews based on their ratings. Here's a step-by-step outline of the process:
#### Data Cleaning: Use NLTK's word_tokenize function to clean and tokenize the text, removing stop words and punctuation.
#### Preprocessing: Using the Tokenizer class from Keras, I transformed the text into sequences of tokens.
#### Padding: Before feeding the sequences into the model, I used padding to ensure all sequences had the same length.
#### Model Training: I trained a Bidirectional LSTM model on the tokenized data, achieving excellent classification results.
#### Evaluation: Finally, I evaluated the model on a testing set to ensure its effectiveness.
